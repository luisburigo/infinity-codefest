# Infinity Codefest (CDD)

## Project Overview

This project was made mainly with:

- **Rust**
- **Axum**
- **Tokio**
- **Redis**

## Documentation

- You can find the Postman generated API docs in the [`docs/api.json`](./docs/api.json).
- Access your ideas, initial plans, and designs on [Eraser](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/5LysoSUDKHU2E5tbvB1I?origin=share).

## Hackathon Focus

Our main focus during the hackathon was to achieve **100% correctness** and to learn more about Rust, which may be a very important language for our future work.

## Hackathon Focus

The main problem we face was likely: 
- Transactions validations 
- race condition on user balance 
- redis usage (since no one here have ever used before).
- Rust Structures, type system, and Error system
